Objective
To build a feature-rich web and mobile application that fosters seamless communication and
collaboration among students, faculty, and administration, enhancing campus life through digital
engagement and accessibility.
Problem Statement
Traditional campus communication channels often rely on emails, notice boards, and manual
processes, leading to delays, inefficiencies, and missed opportunities for engagement. Students
and faculty face challenges in connecting with each other for academic and non-academic
activities, while the administration struggles to effectively disseminate information. A digital
platform is needed to streamline campus operations and foster a sense of community.
